The palate is bursting with fresh tropical fruits and dried herbs; zesty, it shows a minerality that sets up the fresh and dry finish. This light unoaked wine, which undergoes a period of lees ageing, shows just how well the Vermentino grape can perform in McLaren Vale's coastal vineyards. The grapes come from a single vineyard site in Willunga which is about two miles from one of the local beaches.",

After harvesting by hand, the majority of the grapes are de-stemmed, crushed and pressed, a small portion being chilled and then whole bunch pressed. The musts were cold settled for a week and then seeded with selected yeast strains to conduct the alcoholic fermentation. These seeded musts were then transferred to oak barrels, of varying sizes up to 500 litres with 40% new French oak, for fermentation. About a 75% malolactic fermentation is carried out and the wine is aged in oak for about eight months.

The blend is mainly Grenache and Syrah, with the addition of Vermentino providing freshness. Only a few hundred cases are made, assembled from a number of cuv\u00e9es, some fermented and aged in oak barrels. The nose shows intense, complex aromas of strawberry, peach and other stone fruit.

After hand picking, about 60% of the grapes are placed in wooden crates in a well-aerated loft and left to dry until December. During this appassimento the grapes will lose up to 50% of their original weight, in water, concentrating the colour and flavour compounds. These dried grapes are removed from the stems and undergo a slow, long fermentation. In February, this wine is blended with the product of the undried-fruit fermentation, and 50% of this blend is aged in American and French barriques for 12 months. Intense ruby-red, with a bouquet reminiscent of cherry, dried fruit, chocolate and prune; the palate is full-bodied, soft and round, with a spiciness and lingering finish.",

        "description": "Negroamaro is almost exclusively cultivated in Apulia; named after its 2 main characteristics - the near black colour that its wines' show and their slightly bitter taste; although this almost refreshing bitterness is often more than offset by generous dark fruit flavours. Hand-harvest grapes from the province of Taranto, are employed in the production and the wine is aged for 6 months in French oak barrels. This wine has intense fragrances of wild berries, in particular mulberry and blueberry. On the palate, persistent fruity notes stand out, alongside a distinctive bitter note on the velvety finish.",

The ageing is performed in oak casks between 12 and 14 months. This gives to the wine an oak-spice aroma which is a component of the bouquet. Several rackings allow a slow and natural clarification.

The grapes are grown on the Greyfriars estate, on the south-facing chalk-rich soils of the Hogs Back, close to Guildford in Surrey. The grapes are hand-harvested at full ripeness in early October. They are crushed and soaked with their skins for two hours before pressing to release the colour. One third of the grapes are fermented and the wine aged in used oak barriques, the remainder is fermented in stainless steel tanks. The wine spends about three years on the lees and it has a very small dosage of about 5g/l of sugar. It shows a delicate pale colour reminiscent of ros\u00e9 from Provence, hints of vanilla and summer fruits on the nose with fresh, fruity berries on the palate.",
